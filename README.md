# DL_App
Text-to-Image app hosted on AWS using Docker and more things. I'm using Huggingface_hub since the aim of this project isn't really to show that I know how to code up a machine learning model as opposed to just deploying it. 

Steps:

- Create Python Virtual Environment
- Using Pip to Freeze Python Dependencies
- Building the docker image using Dockerfile
- Writing Docker Compose file

This is an app that will run on your localhost on port 7860. If you want to use it pull the github repo, make sure you have all the requirements downloaded (if not use pip install requirements.txt) and then run the app.py file using python. From there it will generate the link to access the webpage.
